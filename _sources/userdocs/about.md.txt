# About CRISPRzip

![activity-prediction](../../img/activity_prediction.png)

CRISPRzip is a physics-based model to study the target 
recognition dynamics of CRISPR-associated nucleases like Cas9
[Eslami-Mossalam et al., 2022](ref-eslami2022). Their interactions with target DNA is represented 
as an energy landscape, with which you can simulate binding and cleavage
kinetics. The parameters have been obtained by machine learning on 
high-throughput data (see [Eslami-Mossalam et al., 2022](ref-eslami2022)). CRISPRzip makes 
quantitative predictions of on-target efficiency and off-target risks of 
different guide RNAs.

With CRISPRzip, we hope to contribute to assessing
the risks that come with particular choices in CRISPR application, and as such
contribute to the development of safe gene editing technology.
